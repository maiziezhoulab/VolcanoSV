# Canu

Canu is a fork of the [Celera Assembler](http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), designed for high-noise single-molecule sequencing (such as the [PacBio](http://www.pacb.com) [RS II](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/rsii/)/[Sequel](http://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/sequel/) or [Oxford Nanopore](https://www.nanoporetech.com/) [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products)).

Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:

* Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using [MHAP](https://github.com/marbl/MHAP)
* Generate corrected sequence consensus
* Trim corrected sequences
* Assemble trimmed corrected sequences

## Install:

* The easiest way to get started is to download a binary [release](http://github.com/marbl/canu/releases).

* Installing with a 'package manager' is not encouraged, but if you have no other choice:
  * Conda: `conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults canu`
  * Homebrew: `brew install brewsci/bio/canu`

* Alternatively, you can use the latest unreleased version from the source code.  This version has not undergone the same testing as a release and so may have unknown bugs or issues generating sub-optimal assemblies. We recommend the release version for most users.

        git clone https://github.com/marbl/canu.git
        cd canu/src
        make -j <number of threads>

 * An *unsupported* Docker image made by Frank FÃ¶rster is at https://hub.docker.com/r/greatfireball/canu/.
